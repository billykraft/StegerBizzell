		<p>Steger Bizzell has designed and overseen the construction of numerous public utility projects in Central Texas</p>

		<p>Our firm is experienced in all aspects of utility design, including permitting, system modeling, control design, construction plans, contract documents and technical specifications, and construction management. We provide the following services to our utility customers:</p>


		<br/><h4>Project Design</h4>
		<p>We prepare construction plans, specifications, contract documents according to the requirements of our clients for projects such as water treatment plants, transmission and distribution lines, pump stations and storage facilities.</p>

		<br/><h4>Permits, Applications for Regulatory Approvals</h4>
		<p>We develop the necessary documents, reports, and studies required for wastewater discharge permits, OSS SCS applications, public water system improvements, as well as reports to support funding through such agencies as USDA RD and the Texas Water Development Board.</p>

		<br/><h4>Hydraulic System Modeling</h4>
		<p>Extended-period simulation models allow us to accurately predict the behavior of a water system, including varying customer demand, pump station behavior, ground storage and elevated tank behavior, and to model a variety of options to determine the most cost-effective solutions for CIP programs.</p>

		<br/><h4>Utility Rate Studies and Utility Tariff Updates</h4>
		<p>We work with our clients to develop equitable rate structures and developer policies that match the desires of the clients while ensuring that growth pays for itself.</p>

		<br/><h4>Capital Improvements Programs and Feasibility Studies</h4>
		<p>We develop long-range plans for our clients to aid them in the orderly growth and improvements to their systems. We perform feasibility studies to develop options for our clients on issues such as water production sources and treatment options. We develop construction standards and standard details.</p>

		<br/><h4>GIS Mapping and Asset Database Design and Development</h4>
		<p>We digitize system assets, including pipelines, meters, valves, tanks and pump stations, to create an on-line geographical database, that allows for powerful mapping capabilities and asset management. A sample GIS map from the GIS database that we recently developed for the Aqua Water Supply Corporation is included in the back of this report.</p>

		<br/><h4>Field Surveying</h4>
		<p>We have full surveying capabilities, including survey-grade RTK GPS stations, and total stations. We can develop LDD- and Microstation-based digital terrain models for site layouts and water and wastewater line plan and profile generation.</p>

		<br/><h4>Control Design</h4>
		<p>We design and specify SCADA systems, as well as plant and pump station control systems. We are particularly familiar with design of pump stations and plants with VFDs (Variable Frequency Drives) that can significantly improve reliability and reduce energy costs.</p>

		<br/><p>We have fostered an excellent working relationship with governmental and regulatory authorities, so that we can efficiently and effectively obtain approvals and permits required to construct projects.</p>

		<p>We have significant experience in all aspects of water and wastewater utility design:</p>

		<li>Hydraulic Water Models</li>
		<li>Integrated GIS Mapping</li>
		<li>Water Treatment Plant Design</li>
		<li>Water Well Design</li>
		<li>Water Distribution and Storage Systems</li>
		<li>Wastewater Discharge Permits</li>
		<li>Wastewater Treatment Plants</li>
		<li>Wastewater Collection Systems</li>
		<li>SCADA Design</li>
		<li>Capital Improvement Programs</li>
		<li>Utility Rate Studies</li>
		<li>Surveying and Easement Acquisition</li>
		<li>Land Planning and Development</li>
		<li>Roads, Bridges and Drainage</li>

		<br/><p>We are problem solvers — by the very nature of our work — and our goal is to provide the best solutions for our clients. Our team of dedicated professionals is partnered with the best state-of-the-art tools and technologies. This combination assures our clients product quality, project uniformity, and economic feasibility in every job we undertake.</p>
